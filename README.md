All My Projects from Beginner to Advanced! 🌟  
It's been a journey filled with code, errors, and a lot of fun memories. Let me share the story of how it all began!

## How It All Started 🤖

It was 2020, the world was hit by COVID-19, and I was just 10 years old. Watching *Iron Man* for the first time, I couldn't stop thinking: *Can I build something like Jarvis?* As a curious kid, I turned to YouTube for answers and stumbled upon a video by **CodeWithHarry**. His videos were awesome, and I was instantly hooked! So, I tried to write my first lines of Python code… and, well, my laptop wasn’t having it. 💻🔧

It turns out you need to install packages to run Python code! (Who knew, right? 😆)

### The Comeback 📈

I put programming aside for a few months, but curiosity got the better of me. I jumped back in, determined to make it work. I started learning Python again, and things finally started to click! I then ventured into **C/C++** and **Java**, and quickly realized they were, uh… not so easy. 😅 After struggling, I remember thinking, “I’ll never understand this!”

But fast forward to today, and here I am, building projects with:
- **Python** 🐍
- **Java** ☕
- **JavaScript** 💻
- **Web Development** 🌐
- **Data Analysis** 📊

…and I’m even tackling **C/C++** and **Machine Learning**!

### Huge Thanks to My Teachers 👩‍🏫👨‍🏫

Special shoutouts to the teachers who made this journey possible:
- **CodeWithHarry**
- **Apna College**
- **Tubeguruji**
- **JavaScript Mastery**

### The Journey Continues 🚀

Every project, every bug, and every late-night “aha” moment has brought me closer to where I want to be. This repository is a collection of all my projects, from the simplest programs to some pretty advanced stuff. I’m excited to keep pushing forward and sharing my journey here. Stay tuned—there’s so much more to come!
